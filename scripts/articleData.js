articles[0].body = [
	`In the months before President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, FBI counterintelligence agents investigating Russian election interference were also collecting evidence suggesting that Trump could be compromised by Russian President Vladimir Putin.`,
	`Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director who oversaw the bureau’s Russia investigation, told me in an interview conducted late last week that concerns about Trump had been building “for some time”—and that he was convinced the FBI would have been justified in opening a case against the president.`,
	`“We felt like we had credible, articulable facts to indicate that a threat to national security may exist,” McCabe told me. And FBI officials felt this way, he said, even before Trump fired Comey. That firing set off a chain of events that, as McCabe put it, turned the world “upside down.” McCabe wrote contemporaneous memos describing “key” conversations he had during that chaotic period—with the president, with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and others—that are now in the hands of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.`,
	`McCabe’s new book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, is not generally overstated in its approach to Trump. This reflects either an aversion to exaggeration on McCabe’s part—his self-image, it seems, is that of a just-the-facts-ma’am G-man—or an awareness that the Justice Department’s inspector general has, for all intents and purposes, branded him a fabulist, a charge he finds particularly wounding. McCabe, who was fired in March 2018, told me he’ll be filing a lawsuit against the Justice Department that will challenge the circumstances of his termination, which was ostensibly based on the inspector general’s findings that he had leaked information to the media without permission. In person, McCabe still seems awed by the “series of head-scratching, completely shocking events” that he witnessed two years ago.`,
	`The bulk of McCabe’s book has little to do with Trump. Much of it focuses on his time working on counterterrorism cases and as the head of an interagency team founded by President Barack Obama to reevaluate the country’s torture practices. Perhaps in a nod to the arc of his career, though, it begins and ends with Trump—McCabe spent his first 10 years at the bureau in New York City, investigating Russian organized crime.`,
	`“It has occurred to me on a number of occasions that, you know, Donald Trump and I know some of the same people,” he told me.`,
	`Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.`,
	`Natasha Bertrand: You don’t talk in the book about the discussions that took place about “wearing a wire” into the Oval Office or invoking the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to remove Trump from office. But you’ve since confirmed that these discussions took place in the days after Comey’s firing in May 2017. What made you and other officials so concerned about Trump’s ability to be president, about his fitness to serve?`,
	`Andrew McCabe: Neither issue is mentioned in the book because I felt like both were so inflammatory and could become very distracting. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment conversation was really nothing more than that. It was something Rod [Rosenstein] brought up off the top of his head in the overall context of thinking about what the president’s intentions were in firing the FBI director and asking us to drop this case. At no time did I think that there was actually an effort under way to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment or remove the president. I heard it discussed, but there weren’t meetings about it. It was simply a comment that Rod made. And I think it’s illustrative of the conditions we were trying to navigate at the time. It was absolutely crazy. The world was upside down.`,
	`Bertrand: Rosenstein really seems to have taken the lead here in throwing out these highly controversial ideas—wearing a wire, invoking the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, etc. How do you square that with his writing the memo that was used later by Trump to justify Comey’s firing?`,
	`McCabe: It was a huge conflict, and one that I struggled with at the time. Rod is the guy that volunteered to write the memo firing Jim Comey, and then, in the days after, he asked me to put him in touch with Jim Comey to discuss the special-counsel selection. So these things were in complete conflict. But at the time, I had to focus on the work we knew we needed to get done and needed to get done quickly. What was important to me was to ensure that we got a special counsel appointed and we put the investigation on as solid ground as we could.`,
	`Bertrand: Before Robert Mueller was appointed, Trump met with the Russian ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office, where he disclosed classified information. How did you react when you found out about that conversation?`,
	`McCabe: It was the latest in a string of head-scratching, completely shocking events. For counterintelligence investigators, the idea that the American president would have a Russian foreign minister and his media into the Oval Office and that he would make a comment like that—a comment that so clearly undermined the effectiveness of his chief law-enforcement and intelligence agency—was just confounding.`,
	`Bertrand: That reminds me of a passage that jumped out at me in your book: “He thought North Korea did not have the capability to launch such missiles. He said he knew this because Vladimir Putin had told him so … the president said he believed Putin despite the PDB [Presidential Daily Briefing] briefer telling him that this was not consistent with any of the intelligence that the US possessed.” How do you explain that?`,
	`McCabe: It’s inexplicable. You have to put yourself in context. So I am in the director’s chair as acting director. My senior executive who had accompanied the briefer to that briefing, who sat in the room with the president and others, and heard the comments, comes back to the Hoover Building to tell me how the briefing went. And he sat at the conference table, and he just looked down at the table with his hands out in front of him. I was like, “How did it go?” And he just—he couldn’t find words to characterize it. We just sat back and said, “What do we do with this now?” How do you effectively convey intelligence to the American president who chooses to believe the Russians over his own intelligence services? And then tells them that to their faces?`,
	`Bertrand: Does this strike you as the behavior of someone who’s compromised?`,
	`McCabe: I mean, it certainly could be. I don’t know that for a fact. That was the reason we initiated the [counterintelligence] investigation. We were concerned, and we felt like we had credible, articulable facts to indicate that a threat to national security may exist. And, in fact, that a crime may have been committed: obstruction of justice. My own view of it is that those two things, the obstruction and the national-security threat, are inextricable. They are two sides of the same coin. To not have opened a case under those circumstances, particularly because the person who’s the subject of that investigation is the president, would have been a complete abdication of our responsibilities.`,
	`Bertrand: How would you respond to criticism that when the counterintelligence investigation into the president was opened, the FBI’s judgment was clouded because emotions were running so high in the aftermath of Comey’s firing?`,
	`McCabe: I could see how that would fit if we had initiated this concern in the wake of Jim’s firing. The fact is, we were building to this point for months before Jim was fired. We had several cases already open under the umbrella investigation of the Russia case … and the concern about the president and whether or not he posed a national-security threat that we should be investigating had been building for some time. But it was the events around the firing that kind of sealed the deal for me and the folks on the team.`,
	`Bertrand: The sense I get from your book is that you sometimes wish you had more forcefully confronted the president when you had the chance, especially after Comey was fired and Trump was pressing you to say that everyone at the bureau was happy about it.`,
	`McCabe: I mean, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how I reacted in those incredibly strange moments and what I said, and I tried to be honest in the book about that kind of reevaluation that you can only do in hindsight, right? But if I had to do it all over again, I’d probably do it just the same way. I was trying desperately to keep a large, distraught organization on its feet and moving forward. And provoking a fight with the president of the United States was not going to be helpful in kind of calming those waters and keeping everybody and getting back to work. I also would not agree with his repeated insistence that everybody was happy about Jim being fired. I would not agree to that under any circumstances.`,
	`Bertrand: Some question now why the public should believe your recollection of events when the Justice Department’s inspector general concluded last year that you had lacked candor when describing your interactions with the press. How would you respond to that?`,
	`McCabe: It was very hard to leave the organization that I loved, and still love to this day, under those circumstances. To spend 21 years as an FBI agent, living under the ideals of fidelity, bravery, and integrity, and then to be branded a liar the day before you were gonna retire. It was very tough. But in some ways, it’s also entirely predictable. The facts are that this president has a long and illustrious history of attacking the credibility of people who say things that he doesn’t like, and I believe strongly that that’s what’s happened here. Firing me for lack of candor was a perfect way to undermine my ability to, who knows, provide testimony against him, to tell these stories that I’ve now told in the book. I never, ever intentionally misled the FBI inspection division, the office of the inspector general, or any director of the FBI, ever. Not ever. I completely reject the findings, the conclusions, and the recommendations in that [inspector general] report. I am very familiar with investigative reports. I’ve been writing them and reading them for 21 years. That is not an investigative report. That was a pretext to reach the conclusion that was being demanded by the president of the United States.`,
	`Bertrand: And how would you respond to the criticism over the Russia investigation being kept a secret from voters in 2016, even though the Clinton email investigation was not? Do you regret not disclosing more about what was known before the election?`,
	`McCabe: No. I see how, on kind of a headline level, there appears to be kind of a fundamental disparity there. I don’t deny that. But you have to really get into the circumstances and the context of each investigation. The Clinton investigation was public before we even got it. The referral to the FBI was public, so we initiated our investigation, and very quickly thereafter the attorney general and Director Comey acknowledged it publicly. The whole world was kind of screaming for that conclusion as we got closer and closer to the election. The Russia investigation was very different … Counterintelligence cases are investigations best pursued quietly, and especially in the lead-up to the election, the idea that we would’ve gone forward with something that we didn’t know we had—I don’t regret handling it the way that we did.`,
	`Bertrand: Shifting gears now to the special-counsel investigation, legal experts have often observed that Mueller seems to be investigating Trump and his campaign like he would a Mafia family. You spent a decade going after the Russian mob in New York. Do you think, given what we’ve seen from Mueller so far, that Trump is still a target?`,
	`McCabe: There are a lot of patterns in what Director Mueller is doing that are very familiar to me. Those patterns of targeting and investigating people who may have had more of a hands-on role, albeit at a lower level, and using those investigations to develop information and informants and cooperators—I mean, it is really the classic enterprise investigation that Director Mueller and his team have pursued. So do I think the case into Trump is open or closed? There’s absolutely no reason for me to believe that it’s closed. And you can certainly look at what Mueller’s done so far to say he is doing exactly what we would do with the investigation of a cartel or an organized-crime family.`,
	`Bertrand: So Trump strikes you as someone who runs his organization, and now is running his administration, like the Mob.`,
	`McCabe: Well, that was my own experience with him, right? That kind of overwhelming or overriding focus on loyalty and sorting everybody out immediately—like, you’re either with us or you’re against us. Those are all traits that you see in organized-crime enterprises.`,
	`Bertrand: Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said in an interview last week that he is concerned the “red line” Trump drew against Mueller examining his finances is being enforced. Having worked with Mueller so closely, do you believe he would be intimidated out of pursuing a key line of inquiry?`,
	`McCabe: I know him pretty well. And I have never known him to be intimidated by anything or anyone. He is at heart an investigator, and he is not the kind of investigator who’s going to be brushed off of a potential area of investigation because he’s afraid of provoking the ire of the president, or making somebody mad, or getting too close to the boundaries. He is going to go wherever he thinks he needs to go to find out what happened.`,
	`Bertrand: Do you think we’ll ever hear from Mueller? Do you think he’ll come out and explain his findings once all this is over?`,
	`McCabe: He’ll explain his findings in the report, and then if he’s called upon to testify about it, he’ll certainly do that. But he is always the guy who will say less than more. He’ll seek less attention than more attention. He is perfectly happy to do his job and to do it fully and completely. And then, when it’s all said and done, he’ll lock the door behind him and go home.`

	`Bradley Beal is selling mall perfume. You know the kiosk. The salesman, uninhibited and sprightly, finds your wandering eye. The speed of his spiel leaves no chance for a polite interruption, no time to rationalize away the guilt you feel in resisting, and so you stop. You listen. You spritz. Not for the product, for the person.`,
	`This weekend was Beal’s second All-Star appearance, but his first pitching the Wizards as a free agency destination to other star players. “I have to. I have to,” Beal told The Athletic heading into the break. “I’ve never been in this position before.” John Wall can’t be that face for Washington anymore. He won’t return to action until next year’s All-Star Weekend after spending half of last season on the sideline as well. Even healthy, Wall’s reputation as a teammate has fallen over the years. Beal had no choice but to usurp him as head of recruiting.`,
	`In the words of LeBron James, tampering rules do not apply at All-Star Weekend. The league penalizes only organizations for talking to players and doesn’t regulate player-to-player interactions, which makes the three-day gathering a sort of recruiting bonanza. Still, Beal is like a mid-major coach among Mike Krzyzewskis and John Caliparis. The top upcoming free agents in Charlotte (like Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, and Kemba Walker) aren’t thinking about the Wizards—at least, there’s no indication they are. Durant and Irving are rumored to want to team up in New York, and James and Davis in Los Angeles.`,
	`The right person can, of course, manufacture unlikely interest. Two All-Stars, Russell Westbrook and Paul George, are proof: Oklahoma City traded for George when he was on an expiring contract, and after a year of rumors that he’d flee to Los Angeles, George re-signed with the Thunder. Credit Westbrook. But of all the organizations who players came representing, Washington was one of the hardest sells. All-Stars on other franchises in trouble, like Davis, Walker, Dwyane Wade, and Nikola Vucevic, could leave after this season, and don’t need to recruit. (Davis will leave assuming his trade request is honored, Wade is retiring, and the other two will become free agents.) Blake Griffin and Karl-Anthony Towns might be more inclined to listen than to promote their own franchises, although they’re under contract for the next three years and five years, respectively.`,
	`Beal resents the new wave of moving around and teaming up, but he has no choice but to engage with it. “I kinda hate it. I hate super teams,” he said. “Like everybody, just get your own team and just try to win with what you’ve got. But it’s like you need five All-Stars to win, especially to beat Golden State at this point.”`,
	`Beal is an old basketball soul in that he wants to retire a Wizard. Society has long attached honor to that kind of ride-or-die pledge—bonus morality points for it being with Washington—because of the unspoken fact that loyalty like that may very well mean a career of martyrdom. The playing field around Beal has changed in the player control era, making the decision to be a “lifer” more of a handicap than before. In the modern NBA, recruiting is the only way for Beal to get out of Washington’s predicament without getting out of Washington.`,
	`Any interest All-Stars have in playing in Washington can be stripped down to interest in playing with Beal, who is under contract through 2021. There’s no reason for a player to trust the front office’s roster-building or savvy; Scott Brooks isn’t a bucket-list coach like Gregg Popovich is; Wall, as aforementioned, is no longer at his peak; and the locker room is a failed chemistry experiment. Beal alone must be enough, because other players did have conversations with him about the Wizards:`,
	`“It was really crazy. A lot of guys were coming to talk to me and asking me how I feel. The recruiting process is really going all right. It’s going all right. I’m trying. This is new for me. So, I’m definitely getting some ears and seeing where guys’ minds are at. Guys were, ‘So, what y’all doing in D.C.? How is D.C.?’ Or I’m asking, ‘What’s your situation? What you thinking about? How you feeling? Any changes need to be made?’”`,
	`Beal didn’t reveal any names—that’s when the tampering rules do step back in—but he left Charlotte with an optimism that Wizards fans haven’t heard in some time. “In July,” Beal said, “hopefully we can do something.” Though that buoyancy would pale if he were assigned to work the books next. Washington offloaded Otto Porter’s maximum contract (good for $56 million the next two seasons) before the deadline, but still have $109 million in total cap allocations for the 2019-20 season. That leaves the team with about $22.8 million in cap space—not enough for a max contract. And that’s the maximum amount the franchise could clear without a trade—they’d have to renounce Tomas Satoransky, Bobby Portis, Trevor Ariza, Jeff Green, and Thomas Bryant to do so.`,
	`Beal is trying to court All-Star-caliber players without cap room. A good amount of cap space will get a free agent paid, but beaucoup cap space opens the chance for multiple players to sign on a team together—there are draws to both the Nets and the Clippers, but the organizations wouldn’t be in so many free agency rumors without the massive amount of money each has available heading into the summer. It’s easier now for a player who’s locked into a contract to leave prematurely than it is for a franchise that’s locked into many contracts to fix its payroll. Considering the state of the Wizards, it’s more believable in this new era that Beal, despite having two seasons left on his current maximum contract, was the one being recruited.`

	`The market has reason to believe that the Fed is going to stop raising interest rates for a while. Less certain is what the central bank will do with the $4 trillion of bonds left on its balance sheet.`,
	`That latter issue is likely to take focus Wednesday when the Federal Open Market Committee releases notes from its January meeting. At that meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow committee members made it clear that they would be “patient” with rate hikes and that for now policy tightening will be on pause.`,
	`However, while Powell indicated he would be watching how the process unfolds, there were no indications the roll-off would slow.`,
	`The Fed currently allows up to $50 billion a month in proceeds from Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, though it does not regularly hit that number. Since the process began the bond portfolio has shrunk by more than $400 billion. The balance sheet had once stood at $4.5 trillion, the product of three rounds of bond buying — quantitative easing — the Fed instituted to lower long-term rates and pull the economy out of the financial crisis.`,
	`Market participants are now wondering how much further the Fed will go. The minutes from the meeting, which helped spark a stock market rally, will be looked at closely.`,
	``,
	`“The minutes from the two preceding meetings – November and December – included important sections on the balance sheet,” Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura, said in a note. “We believe the corresponding section of the January minutes will confirm the Committee’s plans to end balance sheet normalization by end-2019.”`,
	`Several Fed officials have pointed to the end of the year as a likely point for the process to end, but even that remains in flux.`,
	`The key in the discussions thus far is the level of reserves at which the banking industry feels comfortable. The decline in the balance sheet corresponds with a lower level of reserves. Currently, banks are holding about $1.64 trillion in reserves, or nearly $1.5 trillion above the required level.`,
	`Many Fed watchers think the final level will be somewhere just in excess of $1 trillion, though some see it higher.`,
	`“Once we reach $1.1 [trillion] of reserves, the normalization is done,” wrote Jabaz Mathai, head of U.S. rates strategy at Citigroup.`,
	`Markets have expressed concern that the balance sheet rundown is working in tandem with rate hikes to tighten financial conditions. While Fed officials have insisted that the roll-off will happen with minimal market disruptions, the feeling on Wall Street is otherwise.`,
	`“As growth risks pile up externally and internally, the Fed will want to make sure that [quantitative tightening] is not a constraint that weighs down on financial conditions and hence on the economy,” Mathai said. “Our view is that the effects of QE (and by extension QT, and the end of QT) work through the signaling channel. The Fed signaling that QT is ending, is a Fed signaling readiness to cut rates at some not too distant point in the future.”`,
	`Indeed, the market sees no additional rate hikes ahead as the Fed’s benchmark rate sits in a range between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent. Traders actually are assigning a small chance — about 10 percent — to a rate cut by December.`,
	`Another related issue that could come up in the minutes is how Fed officials convey their intentions to the public.`,
	`Powell suffered a series of missteps that began in October when he said the Fed was “a long way” from a neutral rate, and then again in December when he described the balance sheet operation as being on “autopilot.”`,
	`Markets have recovered mostly from those issues, but Fed officials have been discussing how to improve communications, particularly if another crisis hits.`,
	`Bill English, a 20-year Fed veteran and current professor at the Yale School of Management, said officials have some other options available to them to give the public a more reliable road map for future intentions.`,
	`Among them are a “fan chart” for the possible directions of the fed funds rate, and information about the way policy could respond to changing economic conditions.`,
	`“More communication is better,” English said in an interview. “Things can be misunderstood and communication can go badly, but the response to that should be more communication and trying to clarify, and not communicating less. The world of a generation ago when the Fed didn’t communicate much about monetary policy at all isn’t actually a very desirable world for doing monetary policy.”`,
	`The fan chart would be similar to one the committee uses to know display the level of uncertainty around interest rate projections. The intent is to keep investors aware of how much difference there is in various forecasts and reinforce that the rate estimates are not carved in stone.`,
	`“One way or another it is just to suggest that while there is this path for the fed funds rate and the summary of economic projections, there’s a great deal of uncertainty around that path and the committee will adjust that path accordingly under changing circumstances,” English said. “That’s the point you’re trying to make.”`,
	`English said the current discussions around future policy responses could end up with a friendlier view toward negative nominal interest rates, as a recent Fed paper discussed, and quicker action to institute programs like QE.`,

	`News that Amazon will no longer set up shop in Queens has left many supporters of the plan convinced that the critics of the company's arrival sold them down the river.`,
	`The proposed Long Island City office campus, and the controversial $3 billion incentive package intended to help underwrite it, inspired broad support and ardent opposition. Word that the company would call off its plan—and retract the 25,000 jobs it promised—set off a volley of victory cries and bitter recriminations, and could presage a flurry of back-room machinations and backstabbing maneuvers among the state's power elite.`,
	`Perhaps no figure played a more important role in deterring the e-commerce giant than state Sen. Michael Gianaris. Long Island City's representative in the Senate, Gianaris emerged as an early and aggressive critic of the agreement Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio forged with the company. He also leveraged his position as deputy leader of the Democratic conference to get Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins to appoint him to the Public Authorities Control Board, which had to unanimously approve both the $500 million grant the governor promised the company to help construct its headquarters and authority over all local land-use regulation exemptions necessary to convert the 15-acre former industrial site into an office complex.`,
	`In a conversation with Crain's on the day the news of the reversal broke, Gianaris was unrepentant about his stance.`,
	`"If Amazon can't stand up and answer questions from the community they were about to profoundly change with their presence, it shows they were a bad partner to begin with," he said. "I wasn't doing this for any political posturing. This was all about the right thing for my community."`,
	`But business and labor leaders aligned with the governor lashed out at the senator and his allies, noting that public polls showed broad support for the Amazon complex.`,
	`"A small group of politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community—which poll after poll showed overwhelmingly supported bringing Amazon to Long Island City—the state's economic future and the best interests of the people of this state," Cuomo said in a statement. "The New York state Senate has done tremendous damage. They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity."`,
	`The governor's press office was hardly alone in assessing blame. Cuomo-aligned labor unions had been set to reap plenty of work from the project.`,
	`"We will remember which legislators forgot about us and this opportunity," warned Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council. "Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City's economy, bringing with it tens of thousands of solid middle-class jobs. This sends the wrong message to businesses all over the world looking to call New York home. Who will want to come now?"`,
	`The governor's allies at the Partnership for New York City and the Association for a Better New York—groups representing the city's private-sector interests—similarly complained about the politicization of the process.`,
	`"It is critical that in the future, more voices are heard and we prioritize finding real solutions, rather than throwing stones that scare off jobs for New Yorkers," ABNY Chairman Steven Rubenstein said.`,
	`Other pro-Amazon voices targeted Gianaris in particular, blaming him for granting credibility and influence to a small faction of Amazon opponents.`,
	`"There are 25,000 New Yorkers who could have had jobs who now won't, thanks to Mike Gianaris," one source said. "I hope he sleeps well tonight."`,
	`Cuomo, the ABNY and the Real Estate Board of New York took pains to insist the state remains "open for business." But the leadership at the Partnership for New York City said it feared the fracas over Amazon might have tarnished the city's reputation as the international capital of capitalism.`,
	`"The reception Amazon received sent a terrible message to the job creators of the city and the world," said Kathryn Wylde, the group's president.`,
	`It seems certain that the next few months and even years will be ugly ones in Albany, for Gianaris' district and possibly for the city and state as a whole. Those with knowledge of the governor's mindset characterized the relationship between the senator and the most powerful man in the state as already "toxic" and about to get worse.`,
	`"He will do what he has to do to get even," a source told Crain's.`,
	`Cuomo's vindictiveness is legendary. During his first eight years as governor, his will was law in the Empire State. But the dynamic has changed: Both houses of the Legislature now have solid Democratic majorities, and they can challenge his power like never before.`,
	`"The rational action is to sit down and broker peace," one expert said. "But my instinct tells me he's going to escalate and throw gasoline on it."`,
	`The governor has already signaled his strategy: to try to fracture the Senate Democratic conference along geographic and ideological lines, and pit suburban moderates against New York City liberals. His office released a scathing statement accusing state Sen. Todd Kaminsky, the Long Island delegation chair, of having "cowered when he should have shown courage" and of allowing the Senate to "pander to local socialists." Kaminsky's district, like all the new Democratic possessions in Nassau and Suffolk counties, was once a GOP stronghold—and it remains a bastion of support for the governor.`,
	`But political insiders argued that any attempt by the governor or his allies to splinter Stewart-Cousins' conference could set off a spiral of dysfunction. Before 2018, breakaway Democrats aligned with the governor kept Stewart-Cousins from assuming the majority-leader role for six years by forging a power-sharing deal with Republicans. If the governor moves to spread discord against her now, he risks turning a dispute over an economic development program into a full-blown power struggle.`,
	`"I don't think anyone can predict what will happen," one insider said, "because this is an unprecedented situation." `

	`Most virtual reality headset screens are still sort of blurry, but Finnish company Varjo has an unusual approach to changing that. Its industrial VR-1 headset, which is shipping today, combines a super high-resolution center panel with an ordinary screen for peripheral vision. It’s supposed to deliver images that look almost real, albeit with some compromises and a price tag that’s for professionals only.`,
	`The VR-1 calls its center panel a “Bionic Display.” It’s a 1920 x 1080 “micro-OLED” display with a resolution of 3,000 pixels per inch. (For context, last year’s high-resolution prototype display from Google and LG had 1443 ppi.) Within that central strip, images are supposed to roughly match the resolution of the human eye. As Ars Technica, which checked out the headset, puts it, that section looks “every bit as detailed as real life.” Outside that super crisp panel, there’s a 1440 x 1600 display that produces images of more average quality.`,
	`The VR-1’s total 87-degree field of view is smaller than that of the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, let alone the 200 degrees offered by something like Pimax’s more experimental VR headset. The Bionic Display only comprises a slice of it. Ars Technica describes great image quality while you’re looking straight ahead, with a noticeable downgrade outside that. And rendering that high-resolution slice requires more processing power than you’d need for average VR headsets, which are already fairly demanding.`,
	`Varjo isn’t trying to make a headset for completely immersive entertainment. It’s solving specific problems for business clients, like auto designers who need to examine fine details on a full-scale car model or pilots using flight simulators with a lot of small buttons. In addition to its high resolution, the VR-1 includes eye tracking, which is still a premium feature for a VR headset. And Varjo plans to release a camera-studded front-plate that can pass video straight through to the headset, turning it into a mixed reality device.`,
	`The VR-1 uses standard SteamVR base stations for tracking, and it supports both the Unity and Unreal engines, so you could theoretically play games or use other consumer software. But the headset isn’t priced for consumers. It costs $5,995 with an annual service fee of $995, and Varjo stresses that it’s “only available for businesses and academic institutions.” The company is already working with Airbus, Audi, Saab, Volkswagen, and Volvo, among others.`,
	`Consumers won’t necessarily see this dual-display setup in future headsets. It comes with some clear trade-offs at present, and consumer headset makers seem focused on full high-resolution panels. But the VR-1 is an intriguing system for offering incredibly good image quality with present-day tech. For anyone else who wants to buy the headset, it’s available in 34 countries across North America, Europe, and Hong Kong.`,

	`Imagine a highly sophisticated body armor that is tough — a shield that consists largely of water, but is strong enough to prevent mechanical penetration — while being flexible enough for a wearer to easily move body parts, while swimming in water, walking across the ground or rushing to escape danger.`,
	`That description might sound like a suit worn by a fictional hero in the DC Comics franchise, but it actually describes portions of a lobster’s exoskeleton.`,
	`Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard say the soft membrane covering the crustacean’s joints and abdomen — a material that is as tough as the industrial rubber used to make car tires and garden hoses — could guide the development of a new type of flexible body armor for humans, one designed to cover joints such as knees and elbows.`,
	`The researchers’ findings appeared in Acta Materialia.`,
	`“We think this work could motivate flexible armor design,” Ming Guo, d’Arbeloff Career Development Assistant Professor in the mechanical engineering department at MIT, told MIT News, noting that lobsters’ membrane has helped them survive on Earth for more than 100 million years. “If you could make armor out of these types of materials, you could freely move your joints, and it would make you feel more comfortable.”`,
	`[U-Md. researchers develop smart fabric that automatically warms or cools you off]`,
	`Ballistic vests — commonly referred to as “body armor” — are widely used by law enforcement officers and have been credited with saving thousands of officers from handgun and rifle ammunition, according to the National Institute of Justice. But the vests come with challenges as well. As The Washington Post’s Devlin Barrett reported in 2017, Kevlar — tightly woven fiber panels designed to stop bullets from handguns — have expiration dates and usually last no more than five years. Body armor can also be ill-fitting, particularly for female officers who sometimes require custom fitting, according to NIJ.`,
	`Some studies have shown that body armor can also impair the wearer’s marksmanship and focus, as well as increasing “the physiological cost to complete a task when on duty,” simultaneously providing protection and increased risk, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information.`,
	`MIT researchers say that lobsters could offer a solution to the problem plaguing most modern body armors: the more mobility an armor offers, the less it protects the wearer’s body.`,
	`Guo told MIT News that the idea for developing body armor inspired by lobsters arrived while he was eating one and noticed that the transparent membrane on the animal’s belly was difficult to chew. Unlike the crustacean’s bone-like outer shell, the animal’s softer tissues remained a mystery, he said.`,
	`[Friendly nurse or nightmare-inducing machine? How culture programs our taste in robots.]`,
	`Once researchers began to dissect those tissues, they made a surprising discovery. Making significant cuts into the membrane didn’t affect the material’s elasticity. Researchers determined that the elasticity and strength is due to the membrane’s unique structure, which includes tens of thousands of layers that they compare to plywood. The fibers within those layers help the material dissipate energy when it’s under stress, making it “damage tolerant,” researchers wrote.`,
	`“The knowledge learned from the soft membrane of natural lobsters sheds light on designing synthetic soft, yet strong and tough materials for reliable usage under extreme mechanical conditions, including a flexible armor that can provide full-body protection without sacrificing limb mobility,” the study added.`,
	`Guo told MIT News that material designed to replicate the strength and flexibility of lobster membranes could also be used in soft robotics and tissue engineering.`

	`Washington, DC - The administration of President Donald Trump is bypassing the United States Congress to advance the sale of US nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia, despite concerns it would violate US law guarding against technology transfers, according to a new report by a congressional committee.`,
	`Security analysts worry the technology would allow Saudi Arabia to produce nuclear weapons in the future, potentially contributing to an arms race in the Middle East.`,
	`US legislators are concerned about the stability of Saudi leadership under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) because of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the war in Yemen.`,
	`Multiple unnamed "whistleblowers" have come forward to warn about White House attempts to speed the transfer of highly sensitive US nuclear technology to build new nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia, according to the staff report by the House Oversight and Reform Committee.`,
	`"The whistleblowers who came forward have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes," Representative Elijah Cummings, the Democrat chairman of the committee, said in a letter to the White House on Tuesday.`,
	`The committee is investigating efforts by US nuclear power companies to win Trump administration approval to build nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.`,
	`A key target of the Oversight Committee's inquiry is an effort by IP3 International, a consortium of nuclear power producers that began lobbying during the Trump transition in late 2016 and early 2017 to win presidential approval to develop nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia.`,
	`Most recently, Trump met on February 12 with the IP3 International representatives and the chief executive officers of major US nuclear energy producers to discuss developing nuclear power plants in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, a meeting that was initiated by IP3's founder, retired Army General Jack Keane, according to the committee report which cited Bloomberg News.`,
	`The IP3 proposal has been repeatedly promoted to White House officials by Thomas Barrack, according to the report. Barrack is a personal friend of the president who raised $107m for Trump's Inaugural Committee. US prosecutors in New York are investigating the inaugural committee activities.`,
	`The committee released documents describing the IP3 proposal. Cummings' letter further demands documents and emails from the White House related to its discussions of potential nuclear power development in the Middle East.`,
	`Whistleblowers "warned about a working environment inside the White House marked by chaos, dysfunction and backbiting. And they have warned about political appointees ignoring directives from top ethics advisors at the White House who repeatedly and unsuccessfully ordered senior Trump administration officials to halt their efforts", Cummings wrote in the letter.`,
	`Meanwhile, a US Senate proposal offered by Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat - with support from Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican - seeks to block Saudi Arabia from developing bomb material by prohibiting it from enriching uranium or reusing plutonium from any future power plants.`,
	`In addition, the committee report focuses on former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, a retired army general who in 2016 worked as an adviser to a subsidiary of IP3 while he was also serving in Trump's presidential campaign.`,
	`Flynn was an advocate for IP3's plan to sell nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia in the transition period after Trump won the US election and when he joined the White House as national security adviser, according to the unnamed whistleblowers cited in the report.`,
	`As Trump took office in early 2017, Bud McFarlane, former President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser and now an adviser to IP3, emailed Flynn draft documents for the president's signature outlining a new "Marshall Plan for the Middle East" centred on development of dozens of civilian nuclear power plants by US companies.`,
	`Under US law, any deal to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear energy technology would require a prior agreement, approved by Congress, between the US and Saudi Arabia to place fissionable material under the monitoring and control of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency.`,
	`Separately, on January 1, 2017, McFarlane, the founders of IP3 and the CEOs of six companies - Exelon Corp., Toshiba Energy, Bechtel Corp., Centrus, GE Power and Siemens USA - had sent a letter to MBS promoting the proposal, according to the report.`,
	`"This is more about Trump wanting to do favours for the Saudis for financial reasons and to buttress the Saudis against Iran in the region. But the Saudis do not need nuclear power, and if they get it, will only push Iran to restart its nuclear programme," Tom Collina, policy director at the Ploughshares Fund, a non-proliferation advocacy group based in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.`,
	`"This is Trump picking favourites in the Middle East which will not end well," Collina said.`,
	`In 2015, Iran reached agreement with five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the European Union not to develop nuclear weapons in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Iran is receiving technical assistance from Russia in developing civilian nuclear power.`,
	`In May 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear agreement, which had been negotiated by the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama, and re-imposed oil and financial sanctions.`,
	`Iran has continued to comply with the agreement. The EU, Russia and China have refused to go along with US efforts to reimpose sanctions.`,
	`On Sunday, US Vice President Mike Pence clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the Iran deal in competing speeches given at the Munich Security Conference.`,
	`Pence called on European allies to join the US in withdrawing from the agreement, while, for her part, Merkel defended the Iran nuclear deal, saying it effectively limits Tehran's ability to produce bomb material.`

	`The 2019 Honda power unit is “a thing of beauty” and has resulted in the best installation that Red Bull has ever had, according to team principal Christian Horner.`,
	`Red Bull ended its deal with Renault after 12 years in order to join forces with Honda this season, following on from Toro Rosso’s partnership with the Japanese manufacturer last year. Pre-season testing has so far seen the team able to complete significant mileage, and Horner is impressed with the integration between chassis and power unit on the RB15.`,
	`“I think all aspects, ultimately power is a dominating factor but the installation of this engine into this chassis is probably the best one we’ve ever had,” Horner said. “When you look how neatly integrated it is into the chassis, it really is a thing of beauty, and I think the whole engineering team, collectively with Honda, have done a great job installing what looks like a Swiss clock into the back of our chassis.”`,
	`Horner wants to see Red Bull and Honda fighting for victories on a consistent basis this season, but says how realistic that is depends on the power unit gains made by the other three manufacturers.`,
	`“The expectation for us is very much to make progress. New year, new regulations, new engine partner, new driver. Our objective is to try and close that gap between ourselves and Mercedes and Ferrari, and to try and achieve a more consistent performance on a variety of circuits.`,
	`Images by Hone / LAT`,
	`“Previously our strengths were at circuits that were very chassis focused, but we’re hopeful with the changes we’ve made that we will be able to have a more consistent season across a wider variety.`,
	`“I think Honda have had a good winter and certainly they are reducing that gap significantly, but of course what you don’t know is what the others have done. If the others have found another 50kw then we’ve got a big issue.`,
	`“We’ve been very impressed by the approach of Honda and the progress that they’ve made. For us it’s a vital piece of the jigsaw to get us into a competitive position, not just for this year but for next year and potentially beyond.”`

	`The radio signals of almost 300,000 sources have finally reached Earth, and most of them are previously unknown galaxies from the distant universe.`,
	`More than 200 astronomers in 18 countries created a radio sky survey using the Low Frequency Array telescope, known as LOFAR. The first phase of this major survey was published this week, along with 26 research papers describing the results, in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.`,
	`LOFAR is an incredibly sensitive radio survey, mapping the sky with fine detail. It's operated by ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. For the first phase, LOFAR used low radio frequencies to observe about a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere's sky.`,
	`Radio astronomy is another way of revealing the secrets of the universe that optical light can't.`,
	`The radio signals of 300,000 sources appeared, almost all of them galaxies. But researchers were also able to see black holes, to look at the evolution of clusters of galaxies and to measure magnetic fields.`,
	`Astronomers are hoping to use LOFAR to determine where black holes come from by looking at the jets of material they release, which can be seen at radio wavelengths.`,
	`"LOFAR has a remarkable sensitivity and that allows us to see that these jets are present in all of the most massive galaxies, which means that their black holes never stop eating," said Philip Best, one of the study authors and a professor at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy, in a statement.`,
	`Galaxy clusters look like a mass of stars but are really groupings of hundreds or even thousands of galaxies. Sometimes, two galaxies merge, and that creates radio emissions that can span millions of light-years, most likely due to particles accelerated by the merger.`,
	`Radio observations allow astronomers to detect that radiation, caused by energetic shock, and understand how it was formed, according to Amanda Wilber, a doctoral candidate at the University of Hamburg. But it's also shedding light on something else.`,
	`"What we are beginning to see with LOFAR is that, in some cases, clusters of galaxies that are not merging can also show this emission, albeit at a very low level that was previously undetectable. This discovery tells us that, besides merger events, there are other phenomena that can trigger particle acceleration over huge scales," said Annalisa Bonafede, associate professor in the University of Bologna's Department of Physics and Astronomy, in a statement.`,
	`LOFAR also enables astronomers to measure weak magnetic fields in space.`,
	`"The unprecedented accuracy of the LOFAR measurements has allowed us to measure the effect of cosmic magnetic fields on radio waves from a giant radio galaxy that is 11 million light-years in size. This work shows how we can use LOFAR to help us understand the origin of cosmic magnetic fields," said Shane O'Sullivan, professor at the University of Hamburg, in a statement.`,
	`But the actual process of producing the beautiful images of these distant galaxies from data takes not only time but power. LOFAR gathers so much data that the scientists had to process about 10 million DVDs worth of it.`,
	`They were able to use the supercomputer and data center at SURF, the collaborative Dutch organization for information and communications technology, to process the data set in a year -- something that would have taken centuries on a regular computer.`,
	`"These images are now public and will allow astronomers to study the evolution of galaxies in unprecedented detail," said Timothy Shimwell, a staff member at ASTRON, in a statement.`,
	`The 26 papers published this week only encompass the first 2% of the sky survey. Eventually, the team hopes to have images of the entire northern sky, which would contain 15 million radio sources. The researchers believe that these signals will reveal the first massive black holes that formed during the universe's infancy.`

	`Early Sri Lankans turned the bones of the monkeys and squirrels they hunted into these projectile points.`,
	`By Virginia MorellFeb. 19, 2019 , 12:05 PM`,
	`If you picture early humans dining, you likely imagine them sitting down to a barbecue of mammoth, aurochs, and giant elk meat. But in the rainforests of Sri Lanka, where our ancestors ventured about 45,000 years ago, people hunted more modest fare, primarily monkeys and tree squirrels. Then they turned the bones of these animals into projectiles to hunt more of them. The practice continued for tens of thousands of years, making this the longest known record of humans hunting other primates, archaeologists report today.`,
	`Many scientists believed such forests lacked the resources for early humans to successfully settle. Instead, our ancestors apparently quickly adapted to this and other challenging environments (such as high elevations and deserts), in part by figuring out how to reliably hunt difficult-to-catch prey.`,
	`To conduct the research, archaeologist Patrick Roberts of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (SHH) in Jena, Germany, and colleagues analyzed animal bones recovered from Sri Lanka’s Fa Hien Cave in Kalutara during excavations from 2009 and 2012. Materials and artifacts including charcoal, faunal remains, shell beads, and bone and stone tools indicate people occupied the site from about 45,000 to 4000 years ago.`,
	`The scientists analyzed almost 14,500 animal bones and teeth from four periods of occupation and found that gazelle-size mammals were the most common. Monkeys (primarily macaques and purple-faced langurs, the latter of which inhabit the tallest trees, reaching some 45 meters) and tree squirrels made up more than 70% of the identified remains, which also included otters, fish, reptiles, and birds. Fewer than 4% of the bones came from deer, pigs, and bovids, such as buffalo. Many bones bore cut marks from butchery and had been burned, signs that humans processed them for meat.`,
	`Early humans settled in this Sri Lankan cave 45,000 years ago.`,
	`The archaeologists also uncovered numerous microliths (minutely shaped stone tools), whose purpose is as yet unknown, but were likely used for hunting. In addition, they identified some three dozen finished or partially completed bone projectile points. These ancient humans were using “bones from the hunted monkeys to hunt more monkeys,” says study co-author Noel Amano, an archaeologist at SHH.`,
	`Finally, the remains reveal that the early Sri Lankans were sustainable hunters, primarily targeting adult animals, the scientists report today in Nature Communications. “They hunted these animals for nearly 40,000 years, without driving any to extinction,” Roberts says. “So they must have had sophisticated knowledge of monkey life cycles and an understanding of how to use resources wisely.”`,
	`The findings support the idea that, as humans spread across the world, they had to shift from hunting large, roaming animals like mammoth and bison to smaller prey that “could withstand a higher rate of predation,” says archaeologist Robin Dennell at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the study.`,
	`These ancient humans probably already knew how to hunt more agile and elusive game, says Steve Kuhn, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. People had started to hunt small animals in Eurasia about the same time they first entered Sri Lanka, he notes, and so likely arrived with these skills.`,
	`Kuhn also cautions that the early Sri Lankans might not have been such wise resource managers; more likely the human populations were small and “didn’t make much of an impact.” They hunted more monkeys and squirrels and fewer deer or pigs, he thinks, simply because the smaller animals were likely more abundant. Like those of us who don’t have time to shop and cook, and so grab a burger, these early people may have simply hunted and dined on the animals that were most readily available.`

	`Samsung’s promised a much better look at its foldable phone at tomorrow’s big S10 event. We already caught a glimpse of the product late last year at the company’s developer conference, but among the many uncertainties with the product is what the hell the company will name the thing.`,
	`After all, the device essentially represents an entirely new category for Samsung, so older naming conventions could be out the window. The “Galaxy F” name has been floated, but, well, nobody wants that.`,
	`Perennial leaker Evan Blass (who most recently has helped expose the S10 to the world in recent months) says the handset will be the Galaxy Fold. Not bad, I guess. Probably one to go on — certainly a step up from the Galaxy F, which is, frankly, a bit too easily mocked.`,

	`NFL draft expert Mel Kiper isn’t always correct, but he’s undoubtedly one of the best in the business. In his latest mock draft, Kiper has the Ravens using their first round pick on Josh Jacobs, a running back out of Alabama.`,
	`Jacobs, 21, is entering the NFL draft after three collegiate seasons for the Crimson Tide. Last year, Jacobs rushed for 640 yards and 11 touchdowns on 120 attempts, good for an average of 5.3 yards per attempt.`,
	`”Jacobs is a complete player and the most explosive back in this draft. He didn’t get a ton of touches in a talented Crimson Tide rotation, which means he has little tread on his tires,” said Kiper. “There’s a lot to like about Jacobs, who has also shown nice hands in the passing game”.`,
	`As Kiper also notes in his synopsis, Jacobs totaled just 300 touches over three seasons in college, which is 106 less than former Alabama running back Derrick Henry in his 2015 Heisman season alone. While Jacobs lacks the body of work that many other backs in the class have, he’s widely regarded as the consensus top overall back in this years’ draft.`,
	`Jacobs responded well to a larger workload in his junior season and helped lead Alabama to another national title game. Given the Ravens desire for a complete, versatile back and their history of eyeing Alabama prospects, Eric DeCosta would likely consider taking Jacobs in the first round, should he slip to them at #22 overall.`,
	`While the idea of pairing Jacobs with Lamar Jackson as the future QB/RB duo is tantalizing, investing a first round pick on a running back would be bit of a head-scratching decision.`,
	`Baltimore’s running game was the strength of the offense last year, particularly over the second half of the season. Gus Edwards and Kenneth Dixon, both of whom are set to return next year, had strong seasons and anchored the Ravens backfield down the stretch.`,
	`Baltimore could also opt to resign one of their trio of free agent backs in Alex Collins, Ty Montgomery, and Javorius Allen. Even if they let all three walk, Edwards and Dixon did more than enough last season to solidify sizable workloads going forward and showed the potential to be a dynamic 1-2 punch in the backfield.`,
	`Even if the Ravens drafted Jacobs, Edwards and Dixon would still figure to have roles in the offense next year, meaning Jacobs would enter a timeshare at the position. It would be a talented bunch, yes, but this isn’t the year for the Ravens to draft a running back in the first round.`,
	`There are several more pressing needs on the roster. Baltimore needs to solidify the offensive line, add a playmaker at wide receiver, and fill potential holes on the defensive side of the ball (pass rusher, linebacker, etc.). Using their first round pick to address any of these areas makes more sense.`,
	`There’s chance that Edwards one-dimensional running style catches up to him and/or Dixon struggles to stay on the field next season. If that does happen, then Baltimore can utilize next years’ draft or free agency to take a running back.`,
	`For now, Eric DeCosta and the front office should focus their efforts on filling more pressing needs on the roster and addressing areas of weaknesses, which the running back position is not.`,
	`Be sure to leave your thoughts down below!`

	`The entrepreneur made the comment on a podcast Tuesday with Cathie Wood and Tasha Keeney of ARK Invest, a firm that owns shares in the company. Tesla’s automated driver assistance system Autopilot has garnered both positive attention for the sophistication of its features and negative attention for its association with a number of high-profile accidents.`,
	`“I think we will be feature complete — full self-driving — this year,” Musk said. “Meaning the car will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up and take you all the way to your destination without an intervention, this year. I would say I am of certain of that. That is not a question mark.”`,
	`This is in line with previous comments Musk made on Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings call.`,
	`“However,” he added, “people sometimes will extrapolate that to mean now it works with 100 percent certainty, requires no observation, perfectly. This is not the case.”`,
	`In addition, the speed at which the technology makes it into the hands of customers depends on what regulators will allow, Musk added.`,
	`However within two years, the technology ought to be there for cars to operate without any help from a driver at all.`,
	`“My guess as to when we would think it is safe for somebody to essentially fall asleep and wake up at their destination? Probably towards the end of next year,” he said. “That is when I think it would be safe enough for that.”`,

	`Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told NBC's "Today" show on Tuesday that he briefed congressional leaders about the counterintelligence investigation he had opened into President Donald Trump and that "no one objected."`,
	`"That's the important part here," McCabe told Savannah Guthrie, who had asked if he had informed the "Gang of Eight" bipartisan group of leaders on the Hill. "No one objected. Not on legal grounds, not on constitutional grounds and not based on the facts."`,
	`The purpose of the briefing in 2017 was to let the congressional leadership, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan and their Democratic counterparts, know what the FBI was doing in the probe into Russian election interference and possible collusion by the Trump campaign, McCabe said.`,
	`"Opening a case of this nature (is) not something that an FBI director, not something that an acting FBI director would do by yourself, right?" he said. "This was a recommendation that came to me from my team. I reviewed it with our lawyers. I discussed it at length with the deputy attorney general, and I told Congress what we had done."`,
	`NBC News has reached out to the congressional leaders for comment on McCabe's remarks. As is typical of members when asked about classified briefings, several refused to comment, including McConnell, Ryan, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and panel Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Virginia.`,
	`Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May of 2017 after senior Justice Department officials concluded that he had mishandled the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The move temporarily made McCabe the bureau's acting director.`,
	`In a televised interview days later, Trump told NBC News' Lester Holt that he’d been planning to fire Comey even before he received Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's recommendation to do so because "of this Russia thing with Trump."`,
	`In his "Today" interview, McCabe also said Trump's repeated public blasting of him has been "horrific" for him and his family.`,
	`"I can't tell you how horrific it's been to have to endure the threats, the taunts, the bullying of the president of the United States in such a public way," McCabe said. "I try not to take it personally, but it's very hard. It's been incredibly tough on my family."`,
	`The president has repeatedly attacked McCabe on Twitter after he interviewed with CBS's "60 Minutes." Trump called McCabe "a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal & the Russia Hoax — a puppet for Leakin' James Comey."`,
	`Trump continued to tweet about McCabe all throughout the holiday weekend.`,
	`"Remember this, Andrew McCabe didn’t go to the bathroom without the approval of Leakin’ James Comey!" he posted Monday night.`,
	`Speaking with NBC about Trump's attacks on him, McCabe said, "I don't think really anybody takes those tweets by the president very seriously." He added that Trump has been "lying" about the former top FBI official and his family for years.`,
	`Trump has repeatedly claimed that donations made to McCabe's wife's Virginia state Senate campaign by close Clinton ally and then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe played a role in 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Clinton not being charged by the FBI in the email probe.`,
	`The FBI, however, has reportedly said McCabe did not take on oversight of the Clinton email investigation until after his wife lost that race.`,
	`After McCabe's Tuesday interview, Trump tweeted that he "never said anything bad about Andrew McCabe’s wife other than she (they) should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a Crooked Hillary source when Clinton was under investigation by the FBI."`,
	`"I never called his wife a loser to him (another McCabe made up lie)!" he added.`,
	`In his new book, "The Threat," which is out on Tuesday, McCabe describes a call he received from Trump shortly after Comey's firing in which McCabe says Trump brought up his wife's bid for Virginia state Senate. Details of that call were first reported by NBC News in January 2018.`,
	`Trump "said, 'How is your wife?' I said, 'She’s fine.' He said, 'When she lost her election, that must have been very tough to lose. How did she handle losing? Is it tough to lose?' I replied, 'I guess it’s tough to lose anything. But she’s rededicated herself to her career and her job and taking care of kids in the emergency room. That’s what she does,'" McCabe wrote.`,
	`"He replied in a tone that sounded like a sneer," McCabe continued. "He said, 'Yeah, that must’ve been really tough. To lose. To be a loser.'”`,
	`In that CBS interview, which aired in full on Sunday, McCabe said he ordered obstruction of justice and counterintelligence investigations into Trump after he fired Comey and said Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of removing Trump through the 25th Amendment in addition to wearing a wire during a future conversation with the president.`,
	`In a statement Thursday, the Justice Department disputed McCabe's assertions in the interview, calling his recollections "inaccurate and factually incorrect."`,
	`McCabe disputed the DOJ pushback in his Tuesday interview with NBC.`,
	`McCabe was ousted from the bureau last March, just prior to a planned retirement following a Justice Department inspector general's report that said he had misled investigators regarding a leak about the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which he denies. The inspector general referred its findings to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia last year for possible prosecution, and prosecutors reportedly have convened a grand jury on the matter.`,
	`McCabe told CBS and NBC that he believed he was ousted because he further probed Trump. He added that the inspector general's report "was not like anything I have ever read before," saying it disagreed with its conclusions and planned to sue the Justice Department over it.`

	`It's been more than a year since Google, Amazon and eBay apps were removed from the Apple Watch. Now, Google is making a comeback with an updated version of Google Keep, its note-taking app.`,
	`The latest version of Google Keep for iOS, released last night, includes an Apple Watch app for the first time. This makes Keep the first Google app to return to the watch since Google Maps was scrubbed in 2017.`,
	`The straightforward app features a main screen that lists users' 10 most recent notes, presented as cards. Users are able to make new notes and lists by dictating or using the "scribble" feature to write letters on the Watch face. Naturally, you can also add emoji. Users can add more items to existing lists, but they cannot add to existing notes.`,
	`This initial version is basic, but it's an unexpected addition, since historically, Google hasn't supported the Watch outside of its one Maps app. It's also important given that Apple's own note-taking app, Notes, does not work with the Apple Watch. While apps like Bear help fill the void, the wide usage of Google's products means a lot of people could find this handy.`
